This downloads an artifact from your build implemented in python.

## Usage

Specify a repository and an artifact name to download it. To allow
access you have to pass your personal access token.
Optionally a name for the downloaded artifact can be passed and the
time to wait for an artifact to be available for download.

        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        artifact_name: my-artifact
        rename: new-artifact-name    
        wait_seconds: 60  
```
